In almost every situation, itâ€™s best to form a legal entity for your business to protect yourself from personal liability. Every small business owner is then faced with what TYPE of entity to choose. Entity selection is a difficult but extremely important decision. Here are just a few of the considerations:

* Taxation (Single v. Double)
* Investor Profiles (Foreign v. U.S., Non-Profit, Tax Brackets)
* Ability to go Public
* Flexibility in Allocations and Distributions
* Management
* Liability
* Corporate Formalities

A Carlson McKinnon consultant* will discuss your current circumstance and long term plans and help you make the right decision for both today and the future.

Here are three tables showing several differences between the different legal entity and federal income tax types:
